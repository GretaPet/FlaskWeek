add a new todo task, so I know I have a task to be completed
view my todo tasks, so that I know what I need to do
change the description of the task, so I can update its contents after creating it
delete a task, in case I don't need to do that task anymore
set a todo task as completed, so I know which tasks I've already done
set a todo task as incomplete, in case a complete task still needs doing
